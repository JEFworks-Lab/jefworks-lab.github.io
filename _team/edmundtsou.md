description: I'm an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm interested in exploring how machine learning and computational methods can be applied to solve problems in biology and medicine. Outside the lab, I enjoy racket sports (most recently badminton), working out, spending time with friends, and playing chess.
