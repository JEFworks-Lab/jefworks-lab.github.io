title: Rotation Student
description: I am a first-year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering (BME) program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am interested in computational medicine, particularly building and using computational approaches and techniques to solve biomedical problems, specifically those at the intersection of translational research. To wind down, I enjoy reading fictional manhuas and light novels, handsy activities, brain teasers, and walks in nature.
