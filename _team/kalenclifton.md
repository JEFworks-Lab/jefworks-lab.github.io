title: PhD Student
description: I am a PhD student in the biomedical engineering program at Hopkins. I am interested in using math and programming to study biological spatial organization. As an undergraduate at William & Mary, I majored in computational and applied math while pursuing research in biology. For a research project in synthetic biology, I characterized the increase in gene expression that can result from using ribozyme insulators in genetic circuits. Currently, I am involved in supporting STEM education and career development through mentoring the Hopkins iGEM team and serving on the executive board of JHU BME EDGE. Also, I enjoy volleyball and visual arts (infrequently via painting; frequently via television).
