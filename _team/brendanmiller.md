title: Post-doctoral Fellow
description: I am a post-doctoral researcher recently graduated from the Cellular, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics Department at Johns Hopkins Univeristy. I was also part of the Graduate Partnership Program between Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health. During my PhD I developed cancer detection assays based on patterns of DNA methylation in circulating cell-free DNA from blood plasma samples (aka liquid biopsies). I'm excited to integrate my foundational training as a wet lab biologist with computational strategies to help solve fundamental problems in health and disease!
