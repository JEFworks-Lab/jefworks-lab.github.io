description: I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Hopkins. My research focuses on exploring the connection between spatial gene expression and tissue architecture in 2D, with the aim of extending these insights to 3D applications. I am also excited to develop my teaching ability in the hope of one day teaching the next generation of students. Outside of research, I enjoy playing and watching sports, spending time with friends, and watching movies :)
