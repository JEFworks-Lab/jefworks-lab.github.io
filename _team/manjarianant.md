description: I am a Neuroscience PhD student, coadvised by Dr. Justus Kebschull. I am interested in understanding how the genetic and connectivity patterns of cells in the brain change during development and across species, with a focus on the cerebellar nuclei. In my spare time, I like hiking and exploring Baltimore!
