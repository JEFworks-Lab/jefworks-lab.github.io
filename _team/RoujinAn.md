title: PhD Rotation Student
description: I'm a third year PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins, with a hybrid wet-lab/comp background in bio-pharmaceutical science, molecular and computational biology. I am passionate about engineering adaptable platforms, deep-learning-enabled tools and scalable methods to bridge the gap between sequencing/image data and actionable therapeutic insights. My research employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining single-cell multi-omics & spatial transcriptomics & functional genomics with CRISPR perturbation, iPSC models, and in vivo validation to elucidate disease mechanisms, with applications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, and developmental biology. In my free time I enjoy stand-up comedy.
