description: I’m a third-year PhD candidate in Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering with a hybrid wet-lab + computational background. I’m building toward developing widely adaptable platforms, scalable methods and deep-learning enabled tools that translate sequencing-driven discoveries into actionable therapies. I previously worked with and applied genomics-to-function workflows across in silico, in vitro, and in vivo systems, combining single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics with iPSC models, CRISPRi/gene perturbation, lineage tracing, and animal disease models to link variants to mechanisms and validate/prioritize therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis, cancer, and retinal development.
