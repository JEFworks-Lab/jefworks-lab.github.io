abstract: tially within the kidney inner medulla displaying strong oxidative phosphorylation signature in an ischemic environment. We found commonalities between the spatiotemporal transcriptomic presentation of cold ischemia and warm ischemiaâ€’ reperfusion injury, including an induction of an anti-viral like immune response throughout the renal tissue. Altogether, these systems-level biological insights enabled by our full transcriptome temporal characterization unveil a molecular basis for how cold ischemia injury may negatively affect kidney outcomes. Moreover, our spatial analyses highlight pathological developments deep within the renal tissue, suggesting potential opportunities for new insights beyond biopsy-focused superficial tissue examinations.
