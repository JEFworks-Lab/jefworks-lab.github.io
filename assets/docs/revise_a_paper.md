# How to revise a paper

Please follow this checklist in preparing to revise your scientific research paper

## TODO List

1. In the same shared OneDrive folder as the original manuscript (named as [Year]\_[YourName]\_[OneWordPaperName]), create a revision folder named as revision_[date]

2. Copy over the [point by point response to reviewer template](/assets/docs/0_Point_by_Point_Response_template.xlsx) to the folder and rename as 0\_[onewordpapername]\_Point\_by\_Point\_Response.docx. Add the reviewer comments to the point by point response. 

3. Share, discuss, and iterate
